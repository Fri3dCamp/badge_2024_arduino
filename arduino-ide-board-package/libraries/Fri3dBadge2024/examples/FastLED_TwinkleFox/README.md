# Arduino IDE Setup
TLDR; Follow the [general REAMDE.md](../../README.md), then additionally, you need to have the FastLED Library installed.

## Working with the 2024 Fri3d badge in the Arduino IDE
- First read the [general README.md for the Arduino IDE Examples](../../README.md)

## Arduino IDE Setup Steps
- From the Library manager in the Arduino IDE, you need to install the FastLED NeoPixel package by Daniel Garcia.


### Successful upload command output example
For reference here the output that you get for a succesful compilation and upload (on a mac)
As you can see, the compilation gives a warning saying `"No hardware SPI pins defined.  All SPI access will default to bitbanged output"`, this warning can be ignored as far as I know.
